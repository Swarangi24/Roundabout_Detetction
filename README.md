# Roundabout Detection for Database Integration  
## Team: Code_Wizards

### Problem Statement 2:  
**Detecting Missing Roundabouts for Database Integration**

### Objective:
Our goal is to detect roundabouts from provided geometry data and integrate them into the database. The challenge involves identifying roundabouts based on spatial patterns and geometry characteristics, even when attribute data is missing.

### Data Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Multipart to Singlepart:**  
   Converts multipart geometries to individual features for easier processing.

2. **Densify by Interval:**  
   Adds points at regular intervals on geometry edges to enhance circularity detection and polygon formation.

3. **Extract Nodes and Polygonize:**  
   Converts line geometries into closed polygons to detect enclosed features like roundabouts.

4. **Join Attributes by Location:**  
   Joins contextual attributes from nearby layers to detected roundabouts for further filtering and validation.

### Libraries Used:

- `geopandas`: For geospatial data processing
- `shapely`: Geometry operations (union, polygonization, etc.)
- `matplotlib`: Visualizing the geometries
- `os`: Directory and file management
- `fiona`: File input/output for spatial data

├── HERE.ipynb # Jupyter notebook with data processing and analysis
├── polygon.qmd # Quarto Markdown summary of our process
├── polygon.shp # Shapefile (main geometry data)
├── polygon.dbf # Attribute data for shapefile
├── polygon.shx # Index file for shapefile
├── polygon.prj # Projection information

### Output:
- A map showing detected roundabouts.
- A GeoDataFrame that can be merged into the main roundabout database.

### Viewing GeoJSON Files
To view and validate the `.geojson` files visually:

1. Go to [https://geojson.tools/](https://geojson.tools/)
2. Click the "Upload" button or drag & drop any of the following files:
   - `region 1.geojson`
   - `region 2.geojson`
   - `region 3.geojson`
3. The geometries will be rendered on the interactive map.
